## Standalone Install Note

If this environment only installed the current skill, start from the CloudBase main entry and use the published `cloudbase/references/...` paths for sibling skills.

- CloudBase main entry: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/SKILL.md`
- Current skill raw source: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/references/relational-database-web/SKILL.md`

Keep local `references/...` paths for files that ship with the current skill directory. When this file points to a sibling skill such as `auth-tool` or `web-development`, use the standalone fallback URL shown next to that reference.

# CloudBase Relational Database Web SDK

## Activation Contract

### Use this first when

- A browser or Web app must access CloudBase Relational Database through `@cloudbase/js-sdk`.
- The task is specifically about frontend initialization and browser-side query usage.

### Read before writing code if

- You need to distinguish browser SDK usage from MCP database management or backend Node access.
- The request mentions Supabase migration, shared frontend DB client, or browser-side table queries.

### Then also read

- MySQL SQL management and MCP operations -> `../relational-database-tool/SKILL.md` (standalone fallback: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/references/relational-database-tool/SKILL.md`)
- Web auth/login -> `../auth-web/SKILL.md` (standalone fallback: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/references/auth-web/SKILL.md`)
- General Web app setup -> `../web-development/SKILL.md` (standalone fallback: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/references/web-development/SKILL.md`)

### Do NOT use for

- MCP-based SQL provisioning, schema changes, or permissions management.
- Backend/Node service access.
- Document database operations.

### Common mistakes / gotchas

- Initializing SDKs in an MCP management flow.
- Treating `app` itself as the relational database client.
- Re-initializing CloudBase in every component.
- Mixing frontend browser access with admin-style schema mutations.

### Minimal checklist

- Confirm the caller is a Web frontend.
- Keep one shared CloudBase app and one shared relational DB client.
- Route MySQL provisioning/schema work to `relational-database-tool`. If the task says PostgreSQL, CloudBase PG, PG mode, `app.rdb()`, `queryPgDatabase`, `managePgDatabase`, or RLS, route to `postgresql-development` instead.
- Handle auth separately before data access.

## Overview

This skill standardizes the **browser-side initialization pattern** for CloudBase Relational Database.

After initialization, use `db` with Supabase-style query patterns.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @cloudbase/js-sdk
```

## Canonical initialization

```javascript
import cloudbase from "@cloudbase/js-sdk";

const app = cloudbase.init({
  env: "your-env-id"
});

const auth = app.auth;
// Handle login separately

const db = app.rdb();
```

## Initialization rules

- Initialize synchronously.
- Do not lazy-load the SDK with `import("@cloudbase/js-sdk")` unless the framework absolutely requires it.
- Create one shared `db` client and reuse it.
- Do not invent unsupported `cloudbase.init()` options.

## Quick routing

### Use this skill when

- you are wiring browser components to relational tables
- you are replacing a Supabase browser client with CloudBase
- you need a canonical shared frontend `db` client

### Use `relational-database-tool` instead when

- you need to create/destroy MySQL
- you need MySQL DDL or write-SQL administration
- you need to inspect or change MySQL table security rules through MCP

### Use `postgresql-development` instead when

- the task says PostgreSQL, CloudBase PG, PG mode, `app.rdb()`, `queryPgDatabase`, `managePgDatabase`, PostgREST, or RLS
- browser-side table code must use PG semantics rather than legacy NoSQL / MySQL management tools

## Example: shared frontend DB client

```javascript
import cloudbase from "@cloudbase/js-sdk";

const app = cloudbase.init({
  env: "your-env-id"
});

export const db = app.rdb();
```

## Example: Supabase-style query

```javascript
const { data, error } = await db
  .from("posts")
  .select("*")
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });

if (error) {
  console.error("Failed to load posts", error.message);
}
```

## Example: insert / update / delete

```javascript
await db.from("posts").insert({ title: "Hello" });
await db.from("posts").update({ title: "Updated" }).eq("id", 1);
await db.from("posts").delete().eq("id", 1);
```

## Key principle

- `app.rdb()` gives you the relational database client.
- After that point, use Supabase-style query knowledge for table operations.
- Keep schema management and privileged administration outside browser code.
