## Standalone Install Note

If this environment only installed the current skill, start from the CloudBase main entry and use the published `cloudbase/references/...` paths for sibling skills.

- CloudBase main entry: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/SKILL.md`
- Current skill raw source: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/references/cloud-functions/SKILL.md`

Keep local `references/...` paths for files that ship with the current skill directory. When this file points to a sibling skill such as `auth-tool` or `web-development`, use the standalone fallback URL shown next to that reference.

# Cloud Functions Development

## Activation Contract

### Use this first when

- The task is to create, update, deploy, inspect, or debug a CloudBase Event Function or HTTP Function that serves application runtime logic.
- The request mentions function runtime, function logs, `scf_bootstrap`, function triggers, or function gateway exposure.

### Read before writing code if

- You still need to decide between Event Function and HTTP Function.
- The task mentions `manageFunctions`, `queryFunctions`, `manageGateway`, or legacy function-tool names.
- The task might require `callCloudApi` as a fallback for logs or gateway setup.

### Then also read

- Detailed reference routing -> `./references.md`
- Auth setup or provider-related backend work -> `../auth-tool/SKILL.md` (standalone fallback: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/references/auth-tool/SKILL.md`)
- CloudBase Integration Center generated WeChat Pay or Official Account functions -> `../cloudbase-wechat-integration/SKILL.md` (standalone fallback: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/references/cloudbase-wechat-integration/SKILL.md`; official docs: `https://docs.cloudbase.net/integration/introduce/index.md`)
- AI in functions -> `../ai-model-nodejs/SKILL.md` (standalone fallback: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/references/ai-model-nodejs/SKILL.md`)
- Long-lived container services or Agent runtimes -> `../cloudrun-development/SKILL.md` (standalone fallback: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/references/cloudrun-development/SKILL.md`)
- Calling CloudBase official platform APIs from a client or script -> `../http-api/SKILL.md` (standalone fallback: `https://cnb.cool/tencent/cloud/cloudbase/cloudbase-skills/-/git/raw/main/skills/cloudbase/references/http-api/SKILL.md`)

### Do NOT use for

- CloudRun container services.
- Web authentication UI implementation.
- Database-schema design or general data-model work.
- CloudBase official platform API clients or raw HTTP integrations that only consume platform endpoints.
- Creating Integration Center instances through guessed APIs. For WeChat Pay or Official Account generated functions, use `cloudbase-wechat-integration` for the business contract and this skill only for function operations.
- **Tasks that the CloudBase JS SDK can handle directly** — simple data reads/writes, leaderboards, file uploads, real-time queries. Reach for the matching SDK surface before writing a function: `db.collection(...).get/add/update` only for confirmed NoSQL collections, and `app.rdb().from(...)` for CloudBase PG tables. Functions add deployment complexity, CORS configuration, and HTTP gateway binding that the SDK eliminates entirely.

### Common mistakes / gotchas

- Picking the wrong function type and trying to compensate later.
- Confusing official CloudBase API client work with building your own HTTP function.
- Mixing Event Function code shape (`exports.main(event, context)`) with HTTP Function code shape (`req` / `res` on port `9000`).
- Treating HTTP Access as the implementation model for HTTP Functions. HTTP Access is a gateway configuration for Event Functions, not the HTTP Function runtime model.
- Assuming `db.collection("name").add(...)` will create a missing document-database collection automatically. Collection creation is a separate management step.
- Forgetting that runtime cannot be changed after creation.
- Using cloud functions as the first answer for Web login.
- Forgetting that HTTP Functions must ship `scf_bootstrap`, listen on port `9000`, and include dependencies.
- Forgetting to configure function security rules after creating an HTTP Function. Default rules reject anonymous callers with `EXCEED_AUTHORITY`. Note: anonymous login is disabled by default for new environments — if the function needs public access without authentication, configure the security rule to allow all callers rather than relying on anonymous login.
- Mismatching the `scf_bootstrap` Node.js binary path with the function runtime (e.g. using `/var/lang/node18/bin/node` but setting `runtime: "Nodejs16.13"`).
- For Custom Image HTTP Functions: forgetting that TCR, the CloudApp build, and SCF must be in the same region; using `:latest` instead of a unique tag; or confusing the request-driven port-`9000` image model with a long-lived CloudRun container that listens on the injected `PORT`.
- Assuming MCP covers the whole image pipeline. `manageFunctions` covers SCF image deploy (Stage B) via `runtime: "CustomImage"` + `imageConfig`, but the CloudApp custom build → TCR push (Stage A) is a raw Tencent Cloud API path — confirm action names and parameters from official docs before any `callCloudApi` fallback.
- Making code or configuration changes without first following the Change Safety Protocol (`cloudbase-platform/references/protocols/change-safety-protocol.md`).
- Exposing functions publicly or deploying without first completing the checks in `cloudbase-platform/references/protocols/deployment-gate.md`.

### Minimal checklist

- Read [Cloud Functions Execution Checklist](checklist.md) before deployment or runtime changes.
- Decide whether the task is Event Function, HTTP Function, or actually CloudRun.
- Pick the detailed reference file in [references.md](references.md) before writing implementation code.

## Overview

Use this skill when developing, deploying, and operating CloudBase cloud functions. CloudBase has two different programming models:

- **Event Functions**: serverless handlers driven by SDK calls, timers, and other events.
- **HTTP Functions**: standard web services for HTTP endpoints, SSE, or WebSocket workloads. By default they run on a managed runtime (`scf_bootstrap` + zip); when they need custom system libraries or an arbitrary runtime they can instead run from a container image (`Runtime: CustomImage`, deployed from TCR — see `./references/http-functions-custom-image.md`).

## Writing mode at a glance

- If the request is for SDK calls, timers, or event-driven workflows, write an **Event Function** with `exports.main = async (event, context) => {}`.
- If the request is for REST APIs, browser-facing endpoints, SSE, or WebSocket, write an **HTTP Function** with `req` / `res` on port `9000`.
- For Node.js HTTP Functions, default to the native `http` module unless the user explicitly asks for Express, Koa, NestJS, or another framework.
- If the HTTP Function needs custom system libraries or an arbitrary runtime but should still be SCF request-driven and scale to zero, deploy it as a **Custom Image HTTP Function** (`Runtime: CustomImage`) from a TCR image. The container still listens on the fixed port `9000`. See `./references/http-functions-custom-image.md`. This is distinct from a CloudRun container, which listens on the injected `PORT` and runs long-lived.
- If the user mentions HTTP access for an existing Event Function, keep the Event Function code shape and add gateway access separately.

## HTTP Function authoring contract

Use these rules whenever you are writing the function code itself:

- Do not write an HTTP Function as `exports.main(event, context)`. That is the Event Function contract.
- Treat the function as a standard web server process that must listen on port `9000`.
- With Node.js, prefer `http.createServer((req, res) => { ... })` by default so the runtime contract stays explicit.
- With the Node.js native `http` module, do not assume Express-style helpers exist. `req.body`, `req.query`, and `req.params` are not provided for you.
- For Node.js HTTP Functions, choose one module system up front and keep it consistent. Default to CommonJS for simple functions (`require(...)`, no `"type": "module"` in `package.json`) unless you explicitly want ES Modules.
- If you do choose ES Modules (`"type": "module"` + `import ...`), do not mix in CommonJS-only globals or APIs such as `require(...)`, `module.exports`, or bare `__dirname`. In ESM, derive file paths from `import.meta.url` with `fileURLToPath(...)` only when needed.
- With the native `http` module, parse `req.url` yourself with `new URL(...)`, collect the request body from the stream, and only then call `JSON.parse`. Empty bodies should be handled explicitly instead of assuming JSON is always present.
- Return responses explicitly with `res.writeHead(...)` and `res.end(...)`, including `Content-Type` such as `application/json; charset=utf-8` for JSON APIs.
- **Handle CORS headers**. Browsers block cross-origin requests without proper CORS headers. Default to allowing all origins for simple APIs:
  - Respond to `OPTIONS` preflight with `200` and CORS headers
  - Include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (or specific origin) on all responses
  - Include `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS` as needed
  - Include `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type` for JSON requests
- Keep routing and method handling explicit. Unknown paths should return `404`, and known paths with unsupported methods should normally return `405`.
- Keep gateway setup and security-rule changes separate from the runtime code. They affect access, not the HTTP Function programming model.
- Do not add HTTP access service configuration when the task is only to create an HTTP Function itself. Gateway paths or custom domains are separate access-layer work; public invocation requirements should be handled through the function security rule workflow (note: anonymous login is disabled by default).

## Quick decision table

| Question | Choose |
| --- | --- |
| Triggered by SDK calls or timers? | Event Function |
| Needs browser-facing HTTP endpoint? | HTTP Function |
| Needs SSE or WebSocket service? | HTTP Function |
| Needs custom system libraries / arbitrary runtime, but still SCF request-driven + scale-to-zero? | HTTP Function with `Runtime: CustomImage` (deploy from a TCR image) |
| Needs long-lived container runtime or custom system environment? | CloudRun |
| Only needs HTTP access for an existing Event Function? | Event Function + gateway access |

## How to use this skill (for a coding agent)

1. **Choose the correct runtime model first**
   - Event Function -> `exports.main(event, context)`
   - HTTP Function -> web server on port `9000`
   - If the requirement is really a container service, reroute to CloudRun early

2. **Use the converged MCP entrances**
   - Reads -> `queryFunctions`, `queryGateway`
   - Writes -> `manageFunctions`, `manageGateway`
   - Translate legacy names before acting rather than copying them literally

3. **Write code and deploy, do not stop at local files**
   - Use `manageFunctions(action="createFunction")` for creation
   - Use `manageFunctions(action="updateFunctionCode")` for code updates
   - Use `manageFunctions(action="updateFunctionConfig")` for config updates (timeout, memorySize, envVariables)
   - For a Custom Image HTTP Function, call `manageFunctions(action="createFunction")` with `func.runtime="CustomImage"` and `imageConfig` (`imageUri` with tag; `registryId` for enterprise TCR); iterate later with `manageFunctions(action="updateFunctionCode")` + `imageConfig`. No `functionRootPath` is needed because the code lives in the image. See `./references/http-functions-custom-image.md`.
   - Keep `functionRootPath` as the directory that directly contains function folders (e.g., `cloudfunctions/` or `functions/`), NOT the project root and NOT the function subdirectory itself
   - **Prefer MCP tools over CLI** — when MCP tools are available, use `manageFunctions` and `queryFunctions` instead of CLI commands
   - **Do NOT assume CLI is available from task wording alone** — if the available capabilities only include MCP tools, use MCP tools exclusively
   - For batch updates (multiple functions), call `manageFunctions(action="updateFunctionConfig")` individually for each function — MCP does not have a `--all` batch parameter like CLI

4. **Prefer doc-first fallbacks**
   - If a task falls back to `callCloudApi`, first check the official docs or knowledge-base entry for that action
   - Confirm the exact action name and parameter contract before calling it
   - Do not guess raw cloud API payloads from memory

5. **Read the right detailed reference**
   - Event Function details -> `./references/event-functions.md`
   - HTTP Function details -> `./references/http-functions.md`
   - HTTP Function from a container image (`Runtime: CustomImage`, TCR image pipeline) -> `./references/http-functions-custom-image.md`
   - Logs, gateway, env vars, and legacy mappings -> `./references/operations-and-config.md`

## Database write reminder

- If a function will write to CloudBase document database, create the target collection first through console or management tooling.
- `db.collection("feedback").add(...)` only inserts into an existing collection; it does not auto-create `feedback` when absent.
- If the product requirement says "create when missing", implement that as an explicit collection-management step before the first write instead of assuming the runtime write call will provision it.

## Function types comparison

| Feature | Event Function | HTTP Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary trigger | SDK call, timer, event | HTTP request |
| Entry shape | `exports.main(event, context)` | web server with `req` / `res` |
| Port | No port | Must listen on `9000` |
| `scf_bootstrap` | Not required | Required |
| Dependencies | Auto-installed from `package.json` | Must be packaged with function code |
| Best for | serverless handlers, scheduled jobs | APIs, SSE, WebSocket, browser-facing services |

## Minimal code skeletons

### Event Function hello world

`cloudfunctions/hello-event/index.js`

```js
exports.main = async (event, context) => {
  return {
    ok: true,
    message: "hello from event function",
    event,
  };
};
```

`cloudfunctions/hello-event/package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "hello-event",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### HTTP Function hello world

`cloudfunctions/hello-http/index.js`

```js
const http = require("http");
const { URL } = require("url");

// CORS headers — default to * for simple cross-origin APIs
const CORS_HEADERS = {
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, POST, OPTIONS",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
};

function sendJson(res, statusCode, data) {
  res.writeHead(statusCode, {
    "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    ...CORS_HEADERS,
  });
  res.end(JSON.stringify(data));
}

function sendOptions(res) {
  res.writeHead(204, CORS_HEADERS);
  res.end();
}

function readJsonBody(req) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let raw = "";
    req.on("data", (chunk) => { raw += chunk; });
    req.on("end", () => {
      if (!raw) { resolve({}); return; }
      try { resolve(JSON.parse(raw)); } catch (e) { resolve({}); }
    });
    req.on("error", reject);
  });
}

const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  // Handle CORS preflight
  if (req.method === "OPTIONS") {
    return sendOptions(res);
  }

  const url = new URL(req.url || "/", "http://127.0.0.1");

  if (req.method === "GET" && url.pathname === "/") {
    sendJson(res, 200, { ok: true, message: "hello from http function" });
  } else if (req.method === "POST" && url.pathname === "/") {
    const body = await readJsonBody(req);
    sendJson(res, 200, { received: body });
  } else {
    sendJson(res, 404, { error: "Not Found" });
  }
});

server.listen(9000);
```

For a more complete example with routing, method checks, and error handling, see `./references/http-functions.md`.

`cloudfunctions/hello-http/scf_bootstrap`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/var/lang/node18/bin/node index.js
```

The `scf_bootstrap` binary path must match the runtime — see the full mapping table in `./references/http-functions.md`.

`cloudfunctions/hello-http/package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "hello-http",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Preferred tool map

### Function management

- `queryFunctions(action="listFunctions"|"getFunctionDetail")`
- `manageFunctions(action="createFunction")`
- `manageFunctions(action="updateFunctionCode")`
- `manageFunctions(action="updateFunctionConfig")`

### Logs

**Query function logs** — use the `queryFunctions` tool:

- `queryFunctions(action="listFunctionLogs", functionName="xxx")` — list execution logs of a specific function
- `queryFunctions(action="getFunctionLogDetail", requestId="xxx")` — fetch the detail of one log entry

**`queryFunctions` vs `queryLogs`**:
- `queryFunctions` queries execution logs of a single cloud function and requires `functionName`
- `queryLogs` searches CLS (cross-service log aggregation) using CLS query syntax

**Examples**:
```javascript
// List recent logs for cloud function "my-function"
queryFunctions(action="listFunctionLogs", functionName="my-function", limit=10)

// Inspect the log detail for a specific request id
queryFunctions(action="getFunctionLogDetail", requestId="abc-123")

// Cross-service error search via CLS
queryLogs(action="searchLogs", queryString='(src:app OR src:system) AND log:"ERROR"', service="tcb")
```

`queryLogs` `queryString` follows CLS syntax (see https://cloud.tencent.com/document/api/876/128127). The examples below are starting points; adapt them to the concrete log content of your query:
- Function logs: `(src:app OR src:system) AND log:"START RequestId"`
- Aggregated function request status: `| select request_id, max(status_code) as status where ((request_id='xxxx' AND retry_num=0) AND retry_num=0) AND status_code!=202 group by request_id, retry_num`
- Document database (NoSQL): `module:database`
- Document database slow-query events: `module:database AND eventType:(MongoSlowQuery)` — `MongoSlowQuery` is the document-database slow-query event
- Relational database (MySQL): `module:rdb`
- Relational database (MySQL) events: `module:rdb AND eventType:(MysqlFreeze OR MysqlRecover OR MysqlSlowQuery)` — `MysqlFreeze` = freeze, `MysqlRecover` = recover, `MysqlSlowQuery` = slow query
- Workflow (approval flow): `module:workflow`
- Data model: `module:model`
- User permissions: `module:auth`
- LLM trace logs: `module:llm AND logType:llm-tracelog`
- Gateway access logs: `logType:accesslog`
- App publish / delete events: `module:app AND eventType:(AppProdPub OR AppProdDel)` — `AppProdPub` = app publish, `AppProdDel` = app delete

If these are unavailable, read `./references/operations-and-config.md` before any `callCloudApi` fallback

### Gateway exposure

- `queryGateway(action="getRoute")` / `listRoutes` / `listCustomDomains`
- `manageGateway(action="createRoute")` — for HTTP functions pass `type="HTTP"` (maps to `WEB_SCF`); for Event functions pass `type="Event"` (maps to `SCF`). Omit `domain` to use the environment default (`IsDefault`)
- `manageGateway(action="updateRoute")` / `deleteRoute` / `bindCustomDomain` / `deleteCustomDomain`
- Do **not** call deprecated GWAPI actions via `callCloudApi` (`CreateCloudBaseGWAPI`, etc.)
